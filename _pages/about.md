I am a PhD Candidate in Mathematics at Northeastern University. My PhD advisor is [Jose A. Perea](https://www.joperea.com/), and my mentor is [Ben Knudsen](https://knudsen.sites.northeastern.edu/).

My research interests include topological data analysis, more specifically, the further interpretation of persistence diagrams, the applications of sheaf theory, and dimensionality reduction.

I'm currently the vice president of the [AMS Graduate Student Chapter](https://www.ams.org/membership/studentchapters) at Northeastern University, as of January 2024.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a Markdown file for a talk

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.

The current project I am working on is called ”Extracting Sparse Eilenberg-MacLane Coordinates via Principal Bundles”, and it provides a way of extracting topological information from point cloud data using algebraic topology tools. As this project recently comes to a complete stage, I would be very excited to present the academic results and make connections with prestigious speakers at the conference to discuss developments and difficulties in TDA, and possibly the connection of my research with them.

Abstract:
Let $$X$$ be a finite data set sampled from an unknown metric space $$(\mathbb{X},d)$$. The problem this project seeks to address is to develop methods for generating "Eilenberg-MacLane Coordinates", i.e. functions \( f: X \to K(G,n) \) characterizing the non-trivial persistent cohomology classes in PH^n(R(X); G). Using the theory of principal bundles, soft sheaves, and Cech Cohomology, we aim to explicit formulas, a stability theory, and algorithms to generate such "Eilenberg-MacLane Coordinates" for any discrete Abelian group G. A complete proof chain of a one-to-one correspondence connecting PH^n(R(X); G) and f: X -> K(G,n) is presented, with an explicit formula for computing these coordinates, and as the following work, an explicit algorithm is being extracted from this proof chain in ongoing research.

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.

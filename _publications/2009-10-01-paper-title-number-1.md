The current project I am working on, with my advisor Jose A. Perea, is called "Extracting Sparse Eilenberg-MacLane Coordinates via Principal Bundles", and it provides a way of extracting topological information from point cloud data using algebraic topology tools.

We present in this paper an application of the sheaf theory to the problem of nonlinear dimensionality reduction in data analysis. Specifically, we construct Eilenberg-MacLane coordinates — functions from data to Eilenberg-MacLane spaces $$K(G,n)$$ — that encode nontrivial persistent cohomology classes in arbitrary dimensions $$n$$ and coefficients $$G$$. Using soft sheaf theory, we establish a pipeline from persistent cohomology classes to the homotopy classes of such coordinate functions, extending previous results on circular, projective, and lens coordinates to all dimensions and arbitrary discrete Abelian groups. Crucially, our proof is constructive: we derive explicit formulas via inverses of Čech coboundary operators, yielding a recursive algorithm with polynomial complexity based on matrix computations. We validate our approach through experiments on synthetic datasets, and present novel examples of $$K(\mathbb{Z}/2, 2)$$-coordinates not addressed in prior work.

This project has recently come to a complete stage, and a paper is being written on it. A manuscript of this paper can be found [here](https://tonyxiaochenxiao.github.io/files/Paper_V7.2.pdf).

Using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.
